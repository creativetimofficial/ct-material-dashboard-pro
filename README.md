Material Dashboard PRO is a Premium Material Bootstrap 4 Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. It is based on the popular Bootstrap 4 framework and comes packed with multiple third-party plugins. All components are built to fit perfectly with each other, while aligning to the material concepts.

Material Dashboard PRO makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. Inside the archive you will find multiple example pages on how to use all components. And, of course, every element is documented.

This dashboard is the bigger version for the [Material Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard), which is available for free download. We have created the PRO version based on the feedback we received from people using the demo. We tried to keep it as lean as possible, but provide all the necessary tools for developing a complex product. The result is a powerful dashboard that can easily help you build admin panels, CRMs or content management systems.


Material Dashboard PRO has the same line of design as the Material Kit PRO, so they go together quite good. If you think you will need more landing and example pages, be sure to check it out. If you love material design, you'll probably enjoy using these products!
