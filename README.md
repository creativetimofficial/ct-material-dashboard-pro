The most complex and innovative Dashboard Made by [Creative Tim](https://creative-tim.com/). Check our latest Premium Bootstrap 5 Dashboard with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design 2.

Designed for those who like bold elements and beautiful websites. Made of hundred of elements, designed blocks, and fully coded pages, Material Dashboard PRO is ready to help you create stunning websites and web apps.

We created many examples for pages like Sign In, Profile, and so on. Just choose between a Basic Design, an illustration, or a cover and you are good to go!

Material Dashboard PRO makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout comes with two modes: Light & Dark. Inside the archive you will find multiple example pages on how to use all components. And, of course, every element is documented.

**Fully Coded Elements**

Material Dashboard PRO is built with over 300 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented.  

This Premium Bootstrap 5 Dashboard is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless,  
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.
